Multiplayer project using Photon Pun 2 on unity

This is a project I made for a university class where we had to pick a specialisation and explore. I chose to create a multiplayer third person arena shooter.

This project is basically the result of the Photon Pun 2 tutorial with minor changes and improvements regarding my game design.
